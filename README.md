# cgull
cgull (name subject to change) is an innovative C compiler that defies conventions, breaks the mold. It is a partially-fledged C compiler, in complete compliance with the C standard, but that avoids common practices to achieve faster runtimes, lower memory usage, and ensure that programs that aren't guaranteed to work on every compiler won't, guaranteeing portability. We are also firm believers in the idea of novelty: you shouldn't have to rewrite everything to get vastly different behavior. By making certain compiling choices based on the hash of your program, cgull keeps each compilation fresh and exciting, and makes it so each line of code is more powerful than it would be in other compilers.
